# Object-Oriented Java Game Project

## Overview
This project is an object-oriented game developed in Java as part of an ongoing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course.  
The main goal of the project is to design and implement a modular game architecture while applying core OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

The project evolves incrementally throughout the course, with a focus on clean design, maintainability, and clear separation of responsibilities between components.

## Key Features
- Modular object-oriented design
- Clear separation between game logic and entities
- Use of classes, interfaces, and inheritance
- Central game loop managing state and interactions
- Designed to be easily extendable with new game mechanics or entities

---

## Architecture & Design
The project is structured around core OOP concepts:

- **Encapsulation** – Each class is responsible for a single, well-defined role  
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism** – Used to model different game entities and behaviors  
- **Abstraction** – Common behaviors are abstracted to reduce duplication and improve readability  
- **Separation of Concerns** – Game logic, entities, and utilities are kept conceptually separate  

This structure allows the game to scale in complexity while keeping the codebase readable and maintainable.
